# GeneticAlgorithm/AI
 creation and application of a genetic algorithm to solve a linear regression problem

The implementation of the genetic algorithm included specialized elements
such as selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism procedures, which were designed to
improve search speed and quality of results. A tournament-style method was used for selection,
and single-point crossover and random resetting mutation procedures were used to facilitate
crossover and mutation, respectively.

1) Selection :
The Tournament Selection approach is used in this GA; it selects a group
of individuals at random and then selects the best to breed. Using a genetic algorithm,
tournament selection is a selection strategy that picks the most suitable applicants from the
current generation.

2)Cross-Over:
In this GA, two parents exchange genetic material to make two new offspring by using a singlepoint crossover, in which a crossover point is randomly chosen.

3)Mutation:
Using random resetting mutation, a gene is chosen at random and given a new random value within predetermined limitations in this GA.
